Don't think the smaller the lesser, the sun is shining clever:
±ðÈÏÎª
We are the panther leopards bout time to make time forever!

Still alive
I cannot apologise, no
#
On and on, spin my world, like a record now
On and on, I need something I can dance to
#10
Baby I can see you halo
(Walking on sunshine)
You know you're saving my grace
You're everything I need and more
(Walking on sunshine)
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel you halo
#9
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world
There's a room where the light wont find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do Ill be right behind you

One simple truth, she dare not speak
Her light can only blind and burn
Upon their faces pale white
#7
There is nothing you can do to beat me
I'm so good that you can't defeat me
Yeah, I'm awesome
Take caution
Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be
